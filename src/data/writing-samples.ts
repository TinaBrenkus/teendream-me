    content: `Dallas Market Center has two customer types — shop owners who need products from wholesalers, and new wholesalers to rent space at the market center.

This job was fun and challenging because we utilized multiple channels including a huge focus on in-person events. It was also fun because I was surrounded by fashion and home goods in a one million square foot space on a daily basis.

The great thing about creating content for Dallas Market Center is that I was constantly talking to customers face to face. Our team could work with real-time feedback to implement across all of our channels.

It was a constant hustle to come up with new and creative in person ideas that entertained customers at our events.

We would host VIP parties and dinners, special merch, coffee lounges and expert speakers. We also ran a live podcast style show during the 4-6 markets per year.

One of my favorites was a simple "Y'all Wall". People were lining up to take pictures in front of it and posting to social media.`,

    content: `Ranch Hand is a Texas based company that manufactures truck grille guards that quite literally save people's lives. I've been working with Ranch Hand to develop their brand voice across all channels. Focusing on taglines, About Us, web copy, product descriptions and PR.

Ranch Hand launched a brand new bumper series called Midnight. It was the first bumper of its kind and I had to find the voice for the product and product roll out.

**Customer Testimonials — the grille guard saved their lives.**

One of the most impactful projects I worked on for Ranch Hand was a live activation for the huge SEMA show in Las Vegas.

We placed a wrecked truck on the floor that shows the Ranch Hand grille guard still intact. This truck belongs to a real customer who tours with this truck to spread the word about how Ranch Hand saved his life.

My job was to create all of the copy for the signage. We had large walls that told the Ranch Hand story and individual signage throughout the exhibit that talked about the product and the safety features.

We didn't want it to sound too salesy since this live exhibit sells itself. I worked with the Art Director to keep copy and design low key and poignant.`,

I was hired as their very first copywriter on a brand new marketing team to help kick start their public facing image.

I worked closely with the founders and it was fun and exciting. With a graphic designer, we tackled several large projects like rebooting the brand website, creating email funnels, new content pieces, thought leadership articles for major publications and video.

**The Flip Side Report**
I researched, wrote and created a robust new piece of content called the Flip Side Report. Utilizing New Western's unique data from their over 200,000 investors, we were able to put out a published report 3 times a year that got local, national and industry press.

**NewWestern.com**
Working closely with our in house graphic designer, I rewrote the New Western homepage. We wanted to come up with simple and modern messaging that was relatable to investors and home owners.

**The Investor Story**
I launched a video program with longer form content than just social shorts. I interviewed the participants, wrote the script and directed the video crew.

**Ghost writing and thought leadership**
I worked closely with the president and co founder of New Western to write thought leadership articles about the housing market. I'm passionate about what's happening in the housing market and finding solutions to the affordability crisis.`,

Biggest perk — My office was across the street from the Shiner brewery and they had daily free tastings of all the new flavors. The freshest beer ya ever tasted.

Kaspar Companies in Shiner TX developed the Cooler Rest and then asked me to create the entire marketing launch for the product. Origin story, product names and descriptions, email, social media.

**ABOUT US**

At Cooler Rest, we make a seat out of your cooler. You're welcome.

Cooler Rest was born out of necessity. And it all started with an intriguing tale.

Once upon a time a fisherman boarded his boat, off to enjoy the offerings of a salty Texas coast. A prime spot and perfect conditions, the only thing better would be a seat to support his position. His instincts were right, using his favorite cooler as a seat. After all, it also harbored all the fish he would eat.

By the end of the day his catch proved a winner! But then — holy humpback hit and his tired old back could no longer deliver.

And Cooler Rest was born. Now that's happily ever after.

The Cooler Rest has been spotted from coast to coast and kick back to kick back providing chill spots to sit on back porches, tailgates, fishing boats, swimming docks, hunting grounds, picnics in the park, and many, way too many, backyards.

We want you to enjoy what you do outdoors with little fuss and even less effort, all from the comfort of your cooler. See ya outside.`,

I did everything to help this company grow, from landing pages, social media, course content, sales emails and a whole lot of brainstorming, ideating and strategy.

**WRITE DAY BY DAY**
Write Day by Day is a 30 day SMS program from author and writing coach Courtney Maum that helps writers stay accountable and create content daily. I launched an Instagram channel — developed, wrote and created the editorial calendar.

**YOUR CONFIDENCE CODE**
Your Confidence Code is a course based on a NY Times bestselling book, The Confidence Code by journalists and authors Katty Kay and Claire Shipman. I created the strategy and wrote the content for the sales landing page. I also created email newsletters to warm up their email list, sales email sequences, and course content.

**THE FUTURE-READY LEADER**
I worked with Dr. Tasha Eurich to promote and sell her course, The Future-Ready Leader, based on her book, Insight. I created and wrote the content for the landing page of her website. I also strategized and wrote email campaigns to sell the course. This email series needed to be content driven, in Dr. Eurich's voice and targeting an audience of business executives on her email list.`,
